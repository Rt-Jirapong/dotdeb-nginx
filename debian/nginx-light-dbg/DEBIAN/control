Description: nginx web/proxy server (basic version) - debugging symbols
 Nginx ("engine X") is a high-performance web and reverse proxy server
 created by Igor Sysoev. It can be used both as a standalone web server
 and as a proxy to reduce the load on back-end HTTP or mail servers.
 .
 This package provides debugging symbols for nginx-light, to assist in
 debugging issues that you may find. It should not be required for normal
 operation.
